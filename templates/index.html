{% extends "base.html" %}

<!--So what's happening here is that when our index.html file loads, Flask inherits everything from base.html.
It then looks for a block which we called content and injects this content into it.
Now, that word content is a word that we chose.We could have called the block anything. And in fact, if we have multiple blocks on a page, 
that's what we would do.-->
