<h2>{{pagetitle}}</h2>
<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
  when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an
  adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo
  to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
  force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin</h3>
    <p>
      In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the
      mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other
      Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in
      TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This
      was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA
      2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
      Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken
      tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death

    <h3>Fili &amp; Killi</h3>
    <p>
      Fili and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their
      mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and
      great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long
      nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2] As the
      youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent
      scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the
      Misty Mountains.[3]

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Oni was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
      joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
      would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his
      brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the
      Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and
      later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The
      Company of Thorin.

    <h3>Gloin</h3>
    <p>
      In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar,
      the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and
      his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the
      Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely
      Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was
      noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin,
      was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made
      camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.
